# React-Last.fm Internship assignment

For an internship assignment, I was given 8 hours to build a app that using the Last.FM API. Due to the time constraints there are many things left to be desired some of which are obvious bugs. Because it was an assignment for an internship I decided to focus on showing what I can do in 8 hours as opposed to perfecting something small and costing a lot more time.

I have omitted the API key.

### Some of the things I would have liked to have done if I was given more time:
* Fix some big bugs, I.E: navigation to artistpage is possible but without a MBID the app crashes.
* Disallow duplicate favourite albums/artists
* Better style some of the components/ pages
* Allow the user to add songs to their favourites
* Some general improving of some pieces of code, for example the use of default props.

## Once again, please keep in mind this assignment was done within 8 hours and this should only be seen as an indication of what I can do, however due to time constraints I've had to make some choices that would not have been made if more time would be available.
